Naive implementation of the A star algorithm

The A* algorithm is an efficient algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points in a graph or a grid. It combines the use of both a heuristic function and distance values to evaluate the potential costs of a path. This algorithm ensures that the most promising nodes are explored first, reducing the amount of unnecessary evaluation. Its performance depends on the efficiency of the heuristics. Thanks to its effectiveness, many industries, such as robotics, video games, and GPS systems, utilize the A* algorithm for pathfinding.
